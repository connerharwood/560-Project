### Motivation

We use an OLS linear regression model to attempt to measure the relationships between different water use types and Great Salt Lake water volume. Though we add controls such as population and precipitation into our regression, our results are not to be interpreted causally. They are mere associations, and perhaps a first step towards a more in-depth project to get closer to a causal finding.

### Methods

To try to estimate the effect of water use in the GSL Basin on the difference in GSL volume between time *t* and time *t-1*, we define two sets of models. The lagged time period is observed in the same month as the current time period. In the first set of models, we estimate each sector's water use on GSL volume changes. In the second set of models, we estimate total water use on GSL volume changes. Each model is estimated on two sets of data: the first dataset includes data from 1996 to 2014, while the second dataset includes data from 1996 to 2022. The purpose of testing our models on the larger set of data is to see how impactful the 2015 law was on reporting; if we see a drastic change in the effect of water use on GSL volume using the second dataset, we can confidently assume that there is a large difference in trends after 2015.

We chose these models to conduct a descriptive regression analysis as a first step toward causal inference. Measuring the relationship between water use and Great Salt Lake volume inherently implies some level of causality, and our data limitations and lack of more detailed model primarily stop us short of a causal estimate. In order to reach causal inference, we would ideally have near perfect water use data consisting of all water users in the Great Salt Lake Basin reporting their true water usage over a long time period. We would also be able to control for more confounding factors, such as evaporation, temperature, and streamflows entering the GSL. Though some of these data exist, a more thorough model capturing the relationships and interactions between these variables, water use, and GSL volume would be needed for causality. Our data limitations as well as lack of more controls may bias our estimate to prevent a causal interpretation. For example, inconsistent data reporting may bias the estimates of specific use types that report more or less completely during the study frame. Omitted variables such as evaporation and temperature may cause upward bias in our estimate. Overall, our model serves as a solid first step toward finding causal explanations of the effect of water use on the Great Salt Lake.

In the first set of models, we look at the association between water use by each sector and GSL volume, while controlling for precipitation and population. Each water use by sector is log transformed since they are right-skewed (shown in Appendix Figure 3) and contain outliers. We lag all independent variables by one year, since we expect a delayed effect of water use, precipitation, and population on lake volume. Further, we run the model using monthly water use and precipitation, and we impute values for monthly population by assuming that yearly population changes happen linearly from month to month. The results for the first set of models are shown below:

In the first model, we look at how water use by each sector effects GSL volume, while controlling for precipitation and population. Each water use by sector is log transformed since they are right-skewed (shown in Appendix Figure 3). We lag all independent variables by one year, since we expect a delayed effect of water use, precipitation, and population on lake levels. Further, we run the model using monthly water use and precipitation, and we impute values for monthly population by assuming that yearly population changes happen linearly from month to month. The estimating model is as follows:

$$gslvolume_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 agricultural_{t-1} + \beta_2 commercial_{t-1} + \beta_3 domestic_{t-1}+ \beta_4 industrial_{t-1} + \beta_5 irrigation_{t-1} +$$
$$\beta_6 power_{t-1} + \beta_7 watersupply_{t-1} + \beta_8 population_{t-1} + \beta_9 precipitation_{t-1} + u_t$$

The results for Model 1 are shown below:

```

In the second set of models, we look at how total water use, regardless of use type, is related to GSL volume. In this model, we again control for precipitation and population. Total water use is aggregated from monthly log water use, and we run the model using total water use, precipitation, and population. Further, we lag total water use, precipitation, and population by one year, as in the first models. The estimating model is as follows:

$$gslvolume_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 wateruse_{t-1} + \beta_2 population_{t-1} + \beta_3 precipitation_{t-1} + u_t$$

The results for the second set of models are shown below:

```

GSL volume is measured in billions of gallons in the models above. Further, in Table 1, water use variables in each sector are log transformed. Thus, the coefficient estimates on *Agricultural*, *Commercial*, etc. measure the estimated change in GSL volume from time *t-1* to time *t* from a one percent increase in water use by each respective sector in time *t-1*. For example, for Agricultural water use in Table 1, Model 1, a one percent increase in water use by the agricultural sector in time *t-1* is associated with a 86.595 billion gallon decrease in lake volume from time *t-1* to time *t*. In Table 2, water use is interpreted in the same way, but for total water use instead of by sector. The interpretations of the estimated coefficients on precipitation and population are similar to water use; however, these coefficients indicate the estimated change in GSL volume from a one-inch increase in precipitation and a one-person increase in population in time *t-1*. 

### Results

In Model 1 from Table 1, we find that the effect of agricultural water use in time *t-1* on GSL volume in time *t* is significant at the 1% level. Further, as described above, a one-percent change in agricultural water use is associated with a large negative decrease on GSL volume. We find almost no effect of population in time *t-1* on GSL volume in time *t*. Precipitation in time *t-1* has a positive effect on GSL volume; a one-inch increase in precipitation in time *t-1* is associated with an increase in GSL volume by 165 billion gallons. The coefficients on population and precipitation are both significant at the 1% level. All other water uses have coefficient estimates that are negative, with varying significance, apart from irrigation. The coefficient on irrigation implies that a one-percent change in irrigation water use in time *t-1* is associated with an increase in GSL volume of 175.149 billion gallons. This is significant at the 1% level, and this coefficient estimate may imply that the irrigation sector is using their water inefficiently, and the water is flowing back into the Great Salt Lake Basin. 

In Model 1 from Table 2, we find an insignificant relationship between monthly total water use in time *t-1* on GSL volume in time *t*. This result contradicts our hypothesis. As in Table 1, we find no effect of population in time *t-1* on GSL volume in time *t*. Further, we find that a one-inch increase in precipitation in time *t-1* is associated with a 73.407 billion gallon increase in GSL volume in time *t*. The coefficients on population and precipitation are significant at the 5% level and the 1% level, respectively. It is interesting that monthly total water use does not have a significant result. This could be due to data limitations or the type of model we used, as we expect water use to have a significant negative impact on GSL volume.

In both Table 1 and Table 2, Model 2 exhibits quite different results than Model 1. This implies that water use from 2015 to 2022 varies significantly from our time period in Model 1 (1996-2014). This is likely not true, and we attribute this difference in the models to the increase in reporting after the 2015 law.
