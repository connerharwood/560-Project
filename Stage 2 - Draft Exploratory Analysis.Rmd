# Topic and Motivation

We are looking at how water usage in Utah counties lying within the Great Salt Lake Basin has contributed to variations in Great Salt Lake (GSL) water levels, as well as stream flows entering the GSL. We'll also be using predictive analysis to look at potential future changes to GSL levels using water use and population trends. The specific counties we're focusing on, which lie fully or mostly within the GSL Basin, are Box Elder, Cache, Davis, Morgan, Rich, Salt Lake, Tooele, Utah, and Weber.

Utah has been the [fastest growing state since 2010](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/fastest-growing-states), and much of this growth comes in counties closely connected to the Great Salt Lake. The GSL has also been facing dangerously low and decreasing water levels over the past several decades. If this trend continues, the economic, environmental, and ecological consequences to the region would be drastic. Thus, it's important to understand how water use in the Great Salt Lake Basin faced with population pressures will impact the health and future of the Great Salt Lake and its surrounding communities. 

Furthermore, agriculture is the largest water user in the state of Utah, using 68% of the state's water supply, yet only generates 0.2% of Utah's GDP [source](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjU4_Tf8aOCAxU9MjQIHS19CYEQFnoECA4QAw&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.csbs.utah.edu%2F~lozada%2FResearch%2FUtahAgWaterUseHay.docx%23%3A~%3Atext%3DUsing%252068%2525%2520of%2520Utah%27s%2520water%2Cto%2520which%2520we%2520will%2520return.&usg=AOvVaw0IdpqkRNtyRjWG_ycnpIPq&opi=89978449). Thus, itâ€™s important to understand the economic consequences of water use in this sector in order to better manage its use.


# Data Descriptions

**Utah Water Use Data**
Obtained through the Utah Division of Water Rights [here](https://waterrights.utah.gov/asp_apps/generalWaterUse/WaterUseList.asp), this data includes all water rights holders in Utah dating back to 1959. It has records on total monthly water usage in gallons for each water user, and breaks down this usage by type of use (e.g. agricultural, commercial, water supplier), as well as several other variables of interest. It also has latitude and longitude information for most water users, which we may use at some point in the project for spatial analysis. We're looking at data on water usage in the 9 GSL Basin counties.

**Great Salt Lake Elevation Levels**
Obtained through the USGS using the `dataRetrieval` package in R, we've gathered daily water level observations dating back to 1966. The two relevant gauges are the Saltair Boat Harbor gauge in the South arm of the lake, and the gauge near Saline, UT in the North arm (the lake was essentially split into two by a railroad in the 1950s). Since the water levels of the two arms are typically very similar, we've simply used the average of the two gauge values for our observations. The gauges measure surface level elevation above sea level in feet.

**County Resident Population Data**
Obtained through Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/30154), it has yearly resident population numbers for each Utah county dating back to 1970.
