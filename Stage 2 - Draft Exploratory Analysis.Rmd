# Topic and Motivation

We'll be looking at how water use in Utah counties lying within the Great Salt Lake Basin have contributed to variations in Great Salt Lake (GSL) water levels, as well as stream flows entering the GSL. There are several variables that we need to control for in trying to find a relationship that would warrant a larger study project, so we'll primarily be controlling for weather factors like precipitation and temperature. By controlling for weather factors, as well as other factors, we can isolate correlations between water-related land use and water levels and streamflows. Utah has been the [fastest growing state since 2010](https://worldpopulationreview.com/state-rankings/fastest-growing-states), and much of this growth comes in counties closely connected to the Great Salt Lake. The GSL has also been facing dangerously low and decreasing water levels over the past several decades. If this trend continues, the economic and environmental consequences to the region would be drastic. Thus, it's important to understand how the changing composition of water-related land use in the Great Salt Lake Basin will impact the health and future of the Great Salt Lake and its surrounding communities. Furthermore, since agriculture is the largest water user in the state of Utah (it uses about 75% of the state’s water supply), it’s important to understand the economic consequences of water use in this sector.
